# UK Traffic Accidents

The data analysis assignment of the UK Traffic Accidents data that I prepared within the scope of Türk Telekom & TRAI Veri Bilimi ve Analitiği Practicum is attached.

This dataset contains more than 1.6 million traffic accident data for the years 2000-2016 in the UK. Through this data set, answers are sought to questions such as the following.

How does the change in traffic flow affect accidents?
What increases accident rates?
Can we predict accident rates over time?
How did rural and urban areas differ?

Answers to these questions were sought with the codes prepared on the jupyter notebook.

What steps are done is written under each line of code in jupyter notebook.
